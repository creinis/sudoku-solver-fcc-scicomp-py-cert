# Sudoku Solver

# Step 1

# In this project, you will learn about classes and objects by building a sudoku puzzle solver.

# In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. 
# Objects created from a class are instances of that class. You can create a class using this syntax:

# class ClassName:

# First, you will create a 9x9 board by using classes and then populate it with the puzzle values.

# Begin by creating a Board class.

class Board:

# Step 2

# A new instance of a class is created by using the function notation: ClassName(). 
# The instantiation creates an empty object. 
# Classes can have methods, which are like local functions for each instance. 
# Methods are declared as follows:

# class ClassName:
    def method_name():
        pass

# The __init__ method is a special method that allows you to instantiate an object to a customized state. 
# When a class implements an __init__ method, __init__ is automatically called upon instantiation.

# Create an __init__ method inside your Board class.

    def __init__():
        pass
